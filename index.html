   <h1>Who was Gandhi?</h1>  <p>Ghandi was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar, India. He was born in a wealthy family and moved to Africa at age 23 and became a lawyer. One day when he was travelling in Africa he brought a first class ticket to a train. The conductor of the train kicked him out according to the color of his skin even tho he had brought a first class ticket. This event changed the course of his life.</p>

    <h1>What he did?</h1>
    <p>
      After that, Ghandi started forming groups focused on fighting for the freedom of the nation. After fighting in Africa for 21 years Ghandi felt that he couldn't do more and came back to help India. He fought for the freedom of India by organising many protests against the British. One of these was the Salt March where Ghandi and his 50,000 followers marched 240miles to the arabian sea coast to harvest their own salt instead of collecting it from the British.

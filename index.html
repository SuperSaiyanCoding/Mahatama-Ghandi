    <p>Who was Gandhi? Ghandi was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar, India. He was born in a wealthy family and moved to Africa at age 23 and became a lawyer. One day when he was travelling in Africa he brought a first class ticket to a train. The conductor of the train kicked him out according to the color of his skin even tho he had brought a first class ticket. This event changed the course of his life.</p>
